## üí° Idea:
A simple game that has the objective to make the user guess which 'boxes' aren't the wrong ones.  
The user has three lives, each live will be lost every time the wrong box be clicked. 
In each victory will be displayed an unique message for the user.  
The intuition of this project was to train my Sass and Javascript skills.
